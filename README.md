# PAD-SDK
PAD SDK with PHP8 & PHP7 Support

Original Project: https://pad.asp-software.org/padsdk.php

Since the original SDK is not updated any more by its authors, I've updated it to work with php7 and php8.

PAD(R) - Provided by the Association of Software Professionals

PAD(R) is the Portable Application Description, and it helps authors provide product descriptions and specifications to online sources in a standard way, using a standard data format that will allow webmasters and software application librarians to automate app listings. PAD provides a complete content solution for application developers and the webmasters of software catalogs and directories.

PAD SDK
The PAD SDK is a set of include files implementing some classes as an easy to integrate interface on PAD files.

The SDK currently includes:
